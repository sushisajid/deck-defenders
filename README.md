# Deck Defenders

At some point in our lives we may have come across a Supercell game, these were and still are huge in the mobile game industry. One of these games is "Clash Royale".

Clash Royale is sadly very complicated to play now with hundreds of different card types and combinations, so much that it becomes frustrating for beginners.

That is where Deck Defenders comes in. With only 4 different types of cards; Highattack, HighDefence, Mid and Legendary, the players can experience a fair gampelay against a bot.

Features:
-HighAttack card is the quickest and has one of the highest attacks in the game. It can be deployed using the Q key.
-HighDefence card is the tank of the game has the highest hitpoints in the game. It can be deployed using the W key.
-Mid card has the average damage and health. It can be deployed using the W key.
-Legendary card is the most powerful card in the game. It can be deployed using the E key.

After deploying each card, the player has to wait for the cooldown effect to stop in order to use the next card. Each card has a 5 second cooldown whereas the Legendary has a 10 second cooldown.

The cards deploy attack the enemy cards and tower, they can die in the process as well.

The goal is to destroy the enemy tower before they destroy yours.
The game ends when one of the towers is destroyed.
